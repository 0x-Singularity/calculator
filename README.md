# Calculator

This is a simple calculator program written in Go. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Usage

To use the calculator, run the `main.go` file and provide the operation and operands as command-line arguments. For example:

    go run main.go add 10 20

This will add 10 and 20 and print the result.

## Testing

The program includes unit tests for each arithmetic operation. To run the tests, use the following command:

    go test ./calculatorCode -v

This will run all tests in the `calculatorCode` package and print verbose output.
